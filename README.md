# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction

Overview

This project aims to enhance customer experience and optimize the pricing process for used cars by developing a machine learning regression model. The model predicts used car prices based on historical data, taking into account various factors such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and more. The final model is deployed as a Streamlit web application for real-time price predictions.

Features

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and encodes categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies correlations, detects outliers, and visualizes data.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates multiple models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model performance using Grid Search.

Deployment with Streamlit: Provides an interactive web interface for real-time car price predictions.
